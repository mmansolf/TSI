Title: Custom mice Functions for True Score Imputation
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Performs true score imputation (TSI) for psychometric variables with
    measurement error quantified by a reliability estimate (classical test theory)
    or, more generally, a standard error estimate for each score. Piggybacks on
    the mice package (van Buuren & Goothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) by implementing TSI
    as a custom imputation function, allowing TSI to be combined with multiple
    imputation for missing data.
